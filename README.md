This is me learning machine learning using scikit python

Nothing special here. Just wanna store some Machine Learning learning progress to remember my first step one day...

I'm using JetBrain DataSpell to working with these "Numbers" projects, and apperently I'm still not good enough on Machine Learning Engineering.
I'm not directly using Python module, more into Jupiter Notebook file so that I can document every step I made, or making fun of it. I wish Node JS and Kotlin had them too so...

Enjoy the reading.
